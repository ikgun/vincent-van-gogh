                <h2>Early life</h2>
                <article>

                    <p>Van Gogh, the eldest of six children of a Protestant pastor, was born and reared in a small
                        village
                        in the Brabant region of the southern Netherlands. He was a quiet, self-contained youth,
                        spending
                        his free time wandering the countryside to observe nature. At 16 he was apprenticed to The Hague
                        branch of the art dealers Goupil and Co., of which his uncle was a partner. </p>

                    <p>Van Gogh worked for Goupil in London from 1873 to May 1875 and in Paris from that date until
                        April
                        1876. Daily contact with works of art aroused his artistic sensibility, and he soon formed a
                        taste
                        for Rembrandt, Frans Hals, and other Dutch masters, although his preference was for two
                        contemporary
                        French painters, Jean-François Millet and Camille Corot, whose influence was to last throughout
                        his
                        life. Van Gogh disliked art dealing. Moreover, his approach to life darkened when his love was
                        rejected by a London girl in 1874. His burning desire for human affection thwarted, he became
                        increasingly solitary. He worked as a language teacher and lay preacher in England and, in 1877,
                        worked for a bookseller in Dordrecht, Netherlands. Impelled by a longing to serve humanity, he
                        envisaged entering the ministry and took up theology; however, he abandoned this project in 1878
                        for
                        short-term training as an evangelist in Brussels. A conflict with authority ensued when he
                        disputed
                        the orthodox doctrinal approach. Failing to get an appointment after three months, he left to do
                        missionary work among the impoverished population of the Borinage, a coal-mining region in
                        southwestern Belgium. There, in the winter of 1879–80, he experienced the first great spiritual
                        crisis of his life. Living among the poor, he gave away all his worldly goods in an impassioned
                        moment; he was thereupon dismissed by church authorities for a too-literal interpretation of
                        Christian teaching. </p>

                    <p>Penniless and feeling that his faith was destroyed, he sank into despair and withdrew from
                        everyone.
                        “They think I’m a madman,” he told an acquaintance, “because I wanted to be a true Christian.
                        They
                        turned me out like a dog, saying that I was causing a scandal.” It was then that van Gogh began
                        to
                        draw seriously, thereby discovering in 1880 his true vocation as an artist. Van Gogh decided
                        that
                        his mission from then on would be to bring consolation to humanity through art. “I want to give
                        the
                        wretched a brotherly message,” he explained to his brother Theo. “When I sign [my paintings]
                        ‘Vincent,’ it is as one of them.” This realization of his creative powers restored his
                        self-confidence.</p>

                <h2>The productive decade of Vincent van Gogh</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>His artistic career was extremely short, lasting only the 10 years from 1880 to 1890. During the
                        first four years of this period, while acquiring technical proficiency, he confined himself
                        almost
                        entirely to drawings and watercolours. First, he went to study drawing at the Brussels Academy;
                        in
                        1881 he moved to his father’s parsonage at Etten, Netherlands, and began to work from nature.
                    </p>

                    <p>Van Gogh worked hard and methodically but soon perceived the difficulty of self-training and the
                        need to seek the guidance of more experienced artists. Late in 1881 he settled at The Hague to
                        work
                        with a Dutch landscape painter, Anton Mauve. He visited museums and met with other painters. Van
                        Gogh thus extended his technical knowledge and experimented with oil paint in the summer of
                        1882. In
                        1883 the urge to be “alone with nature” and with peasants took him to Drenthe, an isolated part
                        of
                        the northern Netherlands frequented by Mauve and other Dutch artists, where he spent three
                        months
                        before returning home, which was then at Nuenen, another village in the Brabant. He remained at
                        Nuenen during most of 1884 and 1885, and during these years his art grew bolder and more
                        assured. He
                        painted three types of subjects—still life, landscape, and figure—all interrelated by their
                        reference to the daily life of peasants, to the hardships they endured, and to the countryside
                        they
                        cultivated. Émile Zola’s Germinal (1885), a novel about the coal-mining region of France,
                        greatly
                        impressed van Gogh, and sociological criticism is implicit in many of his pictures from this
                        period—e.g., Weavers and The Potato Eaters. Eventually, however, he felt too isolated in Nuenen.
                    </p>

                    <p>His understanding of the possibilities of painting was evolving rapidly; from studying Hals he
                        learned to portray the freshness of a visual impression, while the works of Paolo Veronese and
                        Eugène Delacroix taught him that colour can express something by itself. This led to his
                        enthusiasm
                        for Peter Paul Rubens and inspired his sudden departure for Antwerp, Belgium, where the greatest
                        number of Rubens’s works could be seen. The revelation of Rubens’s mode of direct notation and
                        of
                        his ability to express a mood by a combination of colours proved decisive in the development of
                        van
                        Gogh’s style. Simultaneously, van Gogh discovered Japanese prints and Impressionist painting.
                        All
                        these sources influenced him more than the academic principles taught at the Antwerp Academy,
                        where
                        he was enrolled. His refusal to follow the academy’s dictates led to disputes, and after three
                        months he left precipitately in 1886 to join Theo in Paris. There, still concerned with
                        improving
                        his drawing, van Gogh met Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, and others who were to play
                        historic roles in modern art. They opened his eyes to the latest developments in French
                        painting. At
                        the same time, Theo introduced him to Camille Pissarro, Georges Seurat, and other artists of the
                        Impressionist group.</p>

                    <p>By this time van Gogh was ready for such lessons, and the changes that his painting underwent in
                        Paris between the spring of 1886 and February 1888 led to the creation of his personal idiom and
                        style of brushwork. His palette at last became colourful, his vision less traditional, and his
                        tonalities lighter, as may be seen in his first paintings of Montmartre. By the summer of 1887
                        he
                        was painting in pure colours and using broken brushwork that is at times pointillistic. Finally,
                        by
                        the beginning of 1888, van Gogh’s Post-Impressionist style had crystallized, resulting in such
                        masterpieces as Portrait of Père Tanguy and Self-Portrait in Front of the Easel, as well as in
                        some
                        landscapes of the Parisian suburbs.</p>

                    <p>After two years van Gogh was tired of city life, physically exhausted, and longing “to look at
                        nature under a brighter sky.” His passion was now for “a full effect of colour.” He left Paris
                        in
                        February 1888 for Arles, in southeastern France.</p>

                    <p>The pictures he created over the following 12 months—depicting blossoming fruit trees, views of
                        the
                        town and surroundings, self-portraits, portraits of Roulin the postman and other friends,
                        interiors
                        and exteriors of the house, sunflowers, and landscapes—marked his first great period. In these
                        works
                        he strove to respect the external, visual aspect of a figure or landscape but found himself
                        unable
                        to suppress his own feelings about the subject, which found expression in emphatic contours and
                        heightened effects of colour. Once hesitant to diverge from the traditional techniques of
                        painting
                        he worked so hard to master, he now gave free rein to his individuality and began squeezing his
                        tubes of oil paint directly on the canvas. Van Gogh’s style was spontaneous and instinctive, for
                        he
                        worked with great speed and intensity, determined to capture an effect or a mood while it
                        possessed
                        him. “When anyone says that such and such [painting] is done too quickly,” he told his brother,
                        “you
                        can reply that they have looked at it too fast.”</p>

                    <p>Van Gogh knew that his approach to painting was individualistic, but he also knew that some tasks
                        are beyond the power of isolated individuals to accomplish. In Paris he had hoped to form a
                        separate
                        Impressionist group with Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec, and others whom he believed had similar
                        aims. He
                        rented and decorated a house in Arles with the intention of persuading them to join him and
                        found a
                        working community called “The Studio of the South.” Gauguin arrived in October 1888, and for two
                        months van Gogh and Gauguin worked together; but, while each influenced the other to some
                        extent,
                        their relations rapidly deteriorated because they had opposing ideas and were temperamentally
                        incompatible.</p>

                    <p>Disaster struck on Christmas Eve, 1888. Physically and emotionally exhausted, van Gogh snapped
                        under
                        the strain. He argued with Gauguin and, reportedly, chased him with a razor and cut off the
                        lower
                        half of his own left ear. A sensational news story reported that a deranged van Gogh then
                        visited a
                        brothel near his home and delivered the bloody body part to a woman named Rachel, telling her,
                        “Guard this object carefully.” The 21st-century art historians Hans Kaufmann and Rita Wildegans,
                        however, examined contemporary police records and the artists’ correspondence and concluded, in
                        Van
                        Gogh’s Ohr: Paul Gaugin und der Pakt des Schweigens (2008; “Van Gogh’s Ear: Paul Gauguin and the
                        Pact of Silence”), that it was actually Gauguin who mutilated van Gogh’s ear and that he did so
                        with
                        a sword. Whatever transpired, van Gogh took responsibility and was hospitalized; Gauguin left
                        for
                        Paris.</p>

                <h2>Legacy of Vincent van Gogh</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>Largely on the basis of the works of the last three years of his life, van Gogh is generally
                        considered one of the greatest Dutch painters of all time. His work exerted a powerful influence
                        on
                        the development of much modern painting, in particular on the works of the Fauve painters, Chaim
                        Soutine, and the German Expressionists. Yet of the more than 800 oil paintings and 700 drawings
                        that
                        constitute his life’s work, he sold only one in his lifetime. Always desperately poor, he was
                        sustained by his faith in the urgency of what he had to communicate and by the generosity of
                        Theo,
                        who believed in him implicitly. The letters that he wrote to Theo from 1872 onward, and to other
                        friends, give such a vivid account of his aims and beliefs, his hopes and disappointments, and
                        his
                        fluctuating physical and mental state that they form a unique and touching biographical record
                        that
                        is also a great human document.</p>

                    <p>The name of van Gogh was virtually unknown when he killed himself: only one article about him had
                        appeared during his lifetime. He had exhibited a few canvases at the Salon des Indépendants in
                        Paris
                        between 1888 and 1890 and in Brussels in 1890; both salons showed small commemorative groups of
                        his
                        work in 1891. One-man shows of his work did not occur until 1892.</p>

                    <p>Van Gogh’s fame dates from the early years of the 20th century, and since then his reputation has
                        never ceased to grow. A large part of this reputation is based on the image of van Gogh as a
                        struggling genius, working unappreciated in isolation. The dramatic elements of his
                        life—poverty,
                        self-mutilation, mental breakdown, and suicide—feed the drama of this mythology. The notion that
                        his
                        unorthodox talent was unrecognized and rejected by society heightens the legend, as it is just
                        that
                        sort of isolation and struggle that has come to define the modern concept of the artist. This
                        mythical van Gogh has become almost inseparable from his art, inspiring artists to dramatize his
                        saga in poems, novels, films, operas, dance ensembles, orchestral compositions, and a popular
                        song.
                        Wide and diverse audiences have come to appreciate his art, and the record-breaking attendance
                        at
                        exhibitions of his works—as well as the popularity of commercial items featuring imagery from
                        his
                        oeuvre—reveal that, within the span of a century, van Gogh has become perhaps the most
                        recognized
                        painter of all time. The unprecedented prices his works have attained through auction and the
                        attention paid to forgery scandals have only increased van Gogh’s stature in the public
                        imagination.</p>

                    <p>Because the most sensational events of van Gogh’s life—the conflicts with Gauguin, the mutilation
                        of
                        his left ear, and the suicide—are thinly documented and layered with apocrypha and anecdote,
                        there
                        is a trend in van Gogh studies to penetrate the layers of myth by reconstructing the known facts
                        of
                        the artist’s life. This scholarly analysis has taken many forms. Medical and psychological
                        experts
                        have examined contemporary descriptions of his symptoms and their prescribed treatments in an
                        attempt to diagnose van Gogh’s condition (theories suggest epilepsy, schizophrenia, or both).
                        Other
                        scholars have studied evidence of his interaction with colleagues, neighbours, and relatives and
                        have meticulously examined the sites where van Gogh worked and the locales where he lived. In
                        light
                        of van Gogh’s continually increasing popularity, scholars have even deconstructed the
                        mythologizing
                        process itself. These investigations shed greater light on the artist and his art and also offer
                        further proof that, more than a century after his death, van Gogh’s extraordinary appeal
                        continues
                        to endure and expand.</p>

                    <p>Van Gogh returned home a fortnight later and resumed painting, producing a mirror-image
                        Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear and Pipe, several still lifes, and La Berceuse (Woman Rocking a
                        Cradle; Augustine-Alix Pellicot Roulin, 1851–1930). Several weeks later, he again showed
                        symptoms of
                        mental disturbance severe enough to cause him to be sent back to the hospital. At the end of
                        April
                        1889, fearful of losing his renewed capacity for work, which he regarded as a guarantee of his
                        sanity, he asked to be temporarily shut up in the asylum at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in order to
                        be
                        under medical supervision.</p>

                    <p>Van Gogh stayed there for 12 months, haunted by recurrent attacks, alternating between moods of
                        calm
                        and despair, and working intermittently: The Starry Night, Garden of the Asylum, Cypresses,
                        Olive
                        Trees, Les Alpilles, portraits of doctors, and interpretations of paintings by Rembrandt,
                        Delacroix,
                        and Millet date from this period. The keynote of this phase (1889–90) is fear of losing touch
                        with
                        reality, as well as a certain sadness. Confined for long periods to his cell or the asylum
                        garden,
                        having no choice of subjects, and realizing that his inspiration depended on direct observation,
                        van
                        Gogh fought against having to work from memory. At Saint-Rémy he muted the vivid, sun-drenched
                        colours of the previous summer and tried to make his painting more calm. As he repressed his
                        excitement, however, he involved himself more imaginatively in the drama of the elements,
                        developing
                        a style based on dynamic forms and a vigorous use of line (he often equated line with colour).
                        The
                        best of his Saint-Rémy pictures are thus bolder and more visionary than those of Arles.</p>

                    <p>Van Gogh himself brought this period to an end. Oppressed by homesickness—he painted souvenirs of
                        Holland—and loneliness, he longed to see Theo and the north once more and arrived in Paris in
                        May
                        1890. Four days later he went to stay with a homeopathic doctor-artist, Paul-Ferdinand Gachet, a
                        friend of Pissarro and Paul Cézanne, at Auvers-sur-Oise. Back in a village community such as he
                        had
                        not known since Nuenen, four years earlier, van Gogh worked at first enthusiastically; his
                        choice of
                        subjects such as fields of corn, the river valley, peasants’ cottages, the church, and the town
                        hall
                        reflects his spiritual relief. A modification of his style followed: the natural forms in his
                        paintings became less contorted, and in the northern light he adopted cooler, fresh tonalities.
                        His
                        brushwork became broader and more expressive and his vision of nature more lyrical. Everything
                        in
                        these pictures seems to be moving, living. This phase was short, however, and ended in quarrels
                        with
                        Gachet and feelings of guilt at his financial dependence on Theo (now married and with a son)
                        and
                        his inability to succeed.</p>

                    <p>In despair of ever being able to overcome his loneliness or be cured, van Gogh shot himself. He
                        did
                        not die immediately. When found wounded in his bed, he allegedly said, “I shot myself.…I only
                        hope I
                        haven’t botched it.” That evening, when interrogated by the police, van Gogh refused to answer
                        questions, saying, “What I have done is nobody else’s business. I am free to do what I like with
                        my
                        own body.”</p>

                    <p>Van Gogh died two days later. Theo, his own health broken, died six months later (January 25,
                        1891).
                        In 1914 Theo’s remains were moved to his brother’s grave site, in a little cemetery in Auvers,
                        where
                        today the two brothers lie side by side, with identical tombstones.</p>
